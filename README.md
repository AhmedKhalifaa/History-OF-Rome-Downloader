# History of Rome Downloader
I developed this script to download all 189 Episodes of Mike Duncan's "History of Rome" Podcast automatically, through the links present in the "All History of Rome episodes" text file.\
The Links in the "All History of Rome episodes.txt" files have all been updated from the archive in the [History of Rome](https://thehistoryofrome.typepad.com/)'s Typepad blog, as of the time of writing this, all links are up and running.
