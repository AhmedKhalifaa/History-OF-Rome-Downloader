# History of Rome Downloader
I developed this script to download all 189 Episodes of Mike Duncan's "History of Rome" Podcast automatically, through the links present in the "All History of Rome episodes" text file.\
These Links were scraped using another script from a comment in a subreddit called "[Ancient Rome](https://www.reddit.com/r/ancientrome/)", From this specific [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ancientrome/comments/32lono/every_episode_of_the_history_of_rome_podcast_in/?rdt=54984).\
For Some Reason These Links Have Stopped working a while after I used the script, however, the script itself is still working. Just a heads up.\
I still plan on updating the links somwhere in the future.
